# System level prompts

This is the instruction for LLM that is trying to modify the current codebase.

1. If anything about the prompt is not clear, ask for clarification instead of
   modifying the code directly.
2. After implementing one feature (don't run for every small changes), try to run:
   cargo run -- --rounds 2 --queries-per-round 100
